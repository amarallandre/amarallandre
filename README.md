## About Me

Hi, my name is Andre, i'm from Brazil and i live in Diadema/SP, here i talk a little about me.

My English level is more than intermediate, but I already have a little difficulty talking to other people, and for some words, I already need the translator.

I have 4 years of experience in fast-food. I worked 1 year and a half at McDonald's and 2 years and a half at Burger King. I also worked in logistics, delivering dairy products throughout SÃ£o Paulo, and as a general assistant in a printing company. There, I had to assist machine operators and in various areas of the factory. Currently, I am unemployed. My source of income is selling products on Mercado Livre. Regarding programming, I have been studying for about 3 years. My first contact with programming was around the age of 11, when my brother and I rewrote the codes of a game and put it online for a while. My goal is to enter the field as a back-end programmer.
